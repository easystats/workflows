# `{easystats}`-workflows

GitHub Actions for `{easystats}` packages.

To know more about how to build automation infrastructure to improve
user experience and development workflow of R packages using these
workflows, have a look at these slides:

# Using workflows in your packages

## Reusing workflows

You donâ€™t need to copy these workflows if you are happy as they are. In
this case, you can just reuse the workflow.

For example, if you wanted to use `check-spelling` workflow, your
workflow (in the file `.github/workflows/check-spelling.yaml`) would
look like so:

``` yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master]

name: check-spelling

jobs:
  check-spelling:
    uses: easystats/workflows/.github/workflows/check-spelling.yaml@main
```

## Copying workflows

If you wish to copy any of these workflows in your own pages, you can do
so without asking for any permissions.

Just keep in mind that you will need to change the following lines:

``` yaml
on:
  workflow_call:
  
#name: test-coverage
```

to (e.g.)

``` yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master]
    
name: test-coverage
```
